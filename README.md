# Heilmeier Catechism

### A scathing critique, a proposed replacement

The following is copy/pasted [from the DARPA website](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism):

DARPA operates on the principle that generating big rewards requires taking big risks. But how does the Agency determine what risks are worth taking?

George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the "Heilmeier Catechism" to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.

 - What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
 - How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
 - What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
 - Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
 - What are the risks?
 - How much will it cost?
 - How long will it take?
 - What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

###  The Critique, question by question

We begin with the first question: "What are you trying to do?".  

Regardless of its initial intent, the way this question is used in grant proposals is to justify what the proposer was going to do anyway, namely whatever their specialty happens to be.  Thus for example if the proposer is a researcher in using superconducting quantum circuits to build precision measurement for quantum information science, this proposal will 100% definitely be that.  This question sounds harmless, but by putting it first, and when combined with the nature of specialization in science, it is used as an excuse to keep doing whatever we have already been doing. 


"How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?"

Again, this is a leading question which points the proposer in the opposite direction of innovation. The innovation we need today solves problems which are currently not being recognized.  Forcing people to point to an existing solution which is being "bested" somehow prevents working on problems which address previously unrecognized problems. Again, this might not be the intent, but the results speak for themselves, and are the same as for the first question: this is really just a formula for people who always do the same work to point to the earlier versions of that same work and say they'll beat that in some way.  

Also, and this is extremely important in why these questions give such bad results, this question biases people toward a mindset of "progress", which ignores the possibility that the solution we should focus on is in fact an older one which was abandoned for reasons that we no longer hold valid.  This is *very* often the case with modern problems of building a sustainable civilization in which pre-industrial societies had solutions which are in the long run better than what we do today, but which are ruled out by the Heilmeier grant writing process because they do not "win" over some older design. 

"What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?"

The first half of this is alone reason enough to condemn the whole set of questions, it is the core toxin which has ruined applied science research for the last few decades.  It is novelty for the sake of novelty.  But the second half is also again a leading question to bias against high risk work.  A careful study of the best researchers show that they often expect failure and try things with a very low chance of success.  The entire framework here punishes that kind of innovation and pushes to always deliver "success".  

"Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?"

Here we put "cares" as the criterion by which some unnamed authority is to judge our work, along with "making a difference".  But this is wrong. We should be aiming to provide *benefit* to some real person, and end user.  This seems pedantic.
