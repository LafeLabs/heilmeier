# Heilmeier Catechism

### A scathing critique, a proposed replacement

The following is copy/pasted [from the DARPA website](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism):

-----

DARPA operates on the principle that generating big rewards requires taking big risks. But how does the Agency determine what risks are worth taking?

George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the "Heilmeier Catechism" to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.

 - What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
 - How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
 - What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
 - Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
 - What are the risks?
 - How much will it cost?
 - How long will it take?
 - What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

###  The Critique, question by question

We begin with the first question: "What are you trying to do?".  

Regardless of its initial intent, the way this question is used in grant proposals is to justify what the proposer was going to do anyway, namely whatever their specialty happens to be.  Thus for example if the proposer is a researcher in using superconducting quantum circuits to build precision measurement for quantum information science, this proposal will 100% definitely be that.  This question sounds harmless, but by putting it first, and when combined with the nature of specialization in science, it is used as an excuse to keep doing whatever we have already been doing. 


"How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?"

Again, this is a leading question which points the proposer in the opposite direction of innovation. The innovation we need today solves problems which are currently not being recognized.  Forcing people to point to an existing solution which is being "bested" somehow prevents working on problems which address previously unrecognized problems. Again, this might not be the intent, but the results speak for themselves, and are the same as for the first question: this is really just a formula for people who always do the same work to point to the earlier versions of that same work and say they'll beat that in some way.  

Also, and this is extremely important in why these questions give such bad results, this question biases people toward a mindset of "progress", which ignores the possibility that the solution we should focus on is in fact an older one which was abandoned for reasons that we no longer hold valid.  This is *very* often the case with modern problems of building a sustainable civilization in which pre-industrial societies had solutions which are in the long run better than what we do today, but which are ruled out by the Heilmeier grant writing process because they do not "win" over some older design. 

"What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?"

The first half of this is alone reason enough to condemn the whole set of questions, it is the core toxin which has ruined applied science research for the last few decades.  It is novelty for the sake of novelty.  But the second half is also again a leading question to bias against high risk work.  A careful study of the best researchers show that they often expect failure and try things with a very low chance of success.  The entire framework here punishes that kind of innovation and pushes to always deliver "success".  

"Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?"

This, if taken at face value, is ok.  

"What are the risks?"

One problem of this question is that it ignores the risk of inaction.  If we look at the global benefits of a project the most useful projects will address the problems which we cannot afford not to solve.  Only evaluating the downside risk of action but not inaction biases away from innovation and risk taking, and again this is clearly illustrated in the low risk low innovation work which dominates applied physics.

"How much will it cost?"

This assumes that the cost is always positive, and that our work does not generate posivitive value by itself.  "Cost" refers to money, and this also centers money in the evaluation which leads to "solutions" which ignore the possibility of systems, benefits, and costs outside of money.  Again, inaction is the most expensive course of action in our current case, and the non-financial cost of this path is ignored in existing research frameworks.

"How long will it take?"

Again, this question biases against innovation and high risk research be demanding unrealistic expectations in terms of how predictable outcomes will be, and biases against anything open ended.

"What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?"

Yet another question which can only be realistically answered for work which is highly predictable.  

###  The Failed Framework

Beyond the failure of the actual questions to give good results in terms of applied physics research since the 60's, there is a deeper flaw in this system.  It assumes that researchers are always doing research using money doled out by some funding agent.  It assumes that research needs money, provides no direct benefit(it produces knowledge which someone else uses for benefit), and that some outside authority will ultimately decide what research is done. 

We reject this.  We do research with a global goal in mind, which will be stated below.  We aim to do our work where we are.  We will do it in our living rooms, in our schools, in our work places, in our public libraries, and in any other existing institution we find around us.  Our method is simply to state our goals, find projects which move us toward those goals which provide enough benefit that our community will materially support them, and simply do them without asking for permission.

### Trash Applied Research

Our goal is to build the Trash Magic Complete Set.  This is a collection of technologies which, together:

 - provide for all the material elements of a high quality of life for every single member of our physical community with no restrictions or money of any kind
 - require no materials of any kind which are sourced from outside our immediate physical environment(no mining, no long distance supply chains, only trash, dirty water, natural materials, and ambient energy)
 - contain all the information required to replicate themselves to any other community globally

In Trash Magic research we are not applying for grants, we are choosing what to work on.  We still pitch ideas, but we are pitching to get people to participate, rather than invest(even if the person we pitch is an investor or program manager).  Consuming or using our goods and technologies is included in "participation".  

### Trash Magic Questions

 - What are you working on? 
 - Who are you?
 - Why are you working on this?
 - What personal benefit do you get from doing this project?
 - How does this work bring us closer to the Full Set?
 - What materials does it require now?
 - What is the path to replace all those with local materials(trash debt)?
 - What materials does this project remove from the waste stream?
 - How does this project directly improve the material conditions of our local community?
 - What is the model by which this project can be materially self-sustaining?
 - How does this project replicate itself?
 - What skills are needed for this project?
 - How does this work fit into existing institutions, groups and people?
